## **Description**
A professional portfolio made with React. This portfolio has three different sections. The first section is just my background and a bit about me!  In the projects section it has six different projects on display, all made in different ways with the technologies I've learned through the BootCamp. Lastly, is my contact information for potential employers.

## **Installation**
React and Bootstrap were required to create this project.

## **Usage**
