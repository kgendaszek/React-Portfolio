            Hi! My name is Katie and I am so glad you are here! I have been
            happily married since 2016, we've been together since 2007! We have
            a beautiful daughter, and 3 crazy pets! Two dogs, Loki and Luna, and
            one 3-legged cat, Bucky. When I'm not spending time with my family
            or learning how to code, I love to read. When I was in elementary
            school I used to get in trouble for reading during class! For the
            last 12 years I have worked in retail, more than half of that as
            management. So, while I have no previous job experience with Web
            Development, I bring many other skills to the table. Customer
            service, problem solving, time management,and adaptability, just to
            name a few! I can't wait to learn more, and grow in this field.
